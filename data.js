      "AIMS- WPSYG, an association of young people who have made considerable academic strides in this field and was established in 2018, we believe by mentoring and engaging in a peer-to-peer interaction with young people, the notion that science and mathematics are preserve for a unique group of people will be demystified and hence paving the way for many young females to pursue careers in this sector. The associationâ€™s activities will be started in Mbour in Senegal and will be rolled out in the medium-term to other communities in Senegal and eventually to the rest of the African continent. Ultimately, the association will become a Pan African organization that will have branches in all African countries. The criteria for starting the activities of the organization from Mbour is due to the proximity of the community to the founders of the organization which will ease the organizations of activities at the early stages of its existence.  The association will strategically expand its activities to other locations over time.",
