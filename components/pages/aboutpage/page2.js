            Our society is undergoing numerous technological changes. In just a

            of everyday life is the rapid expansion of the artificial

              To achieve the goal and objectives of AIMS-WPSYG, the following
              internal and external opportunities and challenges have been
              identified by the organization:
            </div>

            <p className=" mx-4  titre font-bold text-md   ">
              - High human capacity

              The membership of the organization comprises highly skilled people

              This will therefore serve as a source of much needed personnel to
              advance to agenda the association
            </div>
            <p className="mx-4  titre font-bold text-md   ">
              - Wide spatial coverage
            </p>
            <div className="p-4">
              With the huge network of women alumni of the African Institute for
              Mathematical Sciences who have gone on to attain blissful
              professional goals located all over the African continent, the
              organization has a large pool of people to tap on in situ for its
              activities when it expands its activities to the rest of the
              African continent.
            </div>
            <p className=" mx-4  titre font-bold text-md   ">

            <div className="p-4">
              Most of the activities of the organization will be designed as
              outreach programs which will either take place at the location of
              the target population or online. This eliminates the need for
              external venues in most cases

              - Availability of members
            </p>
            <div className="px-4">
              Due to the work schedule of AIMS alumni in particular, it is
              anticipated that in some cases, there will be difficulty in
              getting a convenient and suitable time that fits into their plans.
              To ameliorate this, plans will be drawn in partnership members
              concerned and there will be constant engagement with them to
              ensure smooth roll out of all activities.
